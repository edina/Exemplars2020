As a result, there are 23 digits, each of them having accsess to 5 possibe choices, so there will be, as a result, $5^{23}$ possible outputs. Only one is favourable: $i=0$ everywhere, so the chances of getting this result from one shot are $p = 5^{-23}$, meaning $0.00000000....$ already a number too small. To get the same string as before from more trials, you would need roughly $\\frac {1}{p} = 5^{23}$ seconds. How far is this? To give you a scale, imagine we double the length of the string, so after applying the same function, the expected number of trials to get the same answer is $5^{46} = 10^{23}$, each of them taking one second, if we are quick. As a reference frame, the age of Universe is of roughly $3 * 10^{17}$ seconds, so we wait until you reach the age of Universe and 1,000,000 times more!!!

    "Although they seem quite trivial, the whole modern cryptography relies on the Euclidian algorithms shown above and some more number theory, for manipulating huge numbers. For instance, calculating the remainder $2^{83} \\bmod 5 $ is a huge pain and plenty of work has to be done without some proper mathematical knowledge. However, there are some proper theorems which come in hand perfectly at such type of problems. In this way, digits and characters are encoded in the most awkward possible combinations, to encrypt the messages. The RSA Algorithm is typical for what we have just studied here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29 \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes use of the whole discrete algebra to encode messages. Cracking the encoded message is a significant issue and constitutes a topic of research nowadays. Why? Huge numbers (which are typically used for encoding) are very hard to factorize (this is the way to get to the original message). One solution to the whole issue is given by the quantum computing (https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/05/30/65724/how-a-quantum-computer-could-break-2048-bit-rsa-encryption-in-8-hours/), but this is a totally different matter.\n",

Moreover, ponder a bit on the for instruction, as it is heavily used in programming. Also, feel free to work more on this notebook using any commands you would like. <br> <br>\n",
