Such motion was met for the first time in 19th century, when botanist Robert Brown analysed the motion of polen particles on a sample of water. A lot of research has been done on this topic. However, after decades, physicists James Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann and Albert Einstein proved that any sample with huge number of particles exhibits such behaviour. Now, the behaviour is called <b> Brownian Motion </b> in thermodynamics (Have you heard of it before?). Moreover, the random walks are applied in countless other fields, for instance in economy, due to the fluctuations of stocks in the market, or in meteorology. Even some AI is built on such model. <br> <br>Let us try now to visualize the overall trajectory of the particle in a brownian motion (Very nice visualizations can be made using this type of motion): Initialize the x and y coordinate numpy arrays.\n",
