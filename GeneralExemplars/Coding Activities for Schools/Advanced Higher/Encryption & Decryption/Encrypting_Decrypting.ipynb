For instance, calculating the remainder $2^{83} \\bmod 5 $ is a huge pain and plenty of work has to be done without some proper mathematical knowledge. However, there are some proper theorems which come in hand perfectly at such type of problems. In this way, digits and characters are encoded in the most awkward possible combinations, to encrypt the messages. The RSA Algorithm is typical for what we have just studied here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29 \n",

Huge numbers (which are typically used for encoding) are very hard to factorize (this is the way to get to the original message). One solution to the whole issue is given by the quantum computing (https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/05/30/65724/how-a-quantum-computer-could-break-2048-bit-rsa-encryption-in-8-hours/), but this is a totally different matter."
