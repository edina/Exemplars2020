A variable called ok (change the name if you do not like it) changes its value for good if a divisor is found for the integer n. Debug the function to make sure of it (This is to be done in the class), do not panic, the library is aready imported for you. So, in theory, the function takes all the values from 2 to $ n/2 $ and checks the division of n by each number. As a consequence, the larger n is, the more time it will take for the algorithm to check if the number is prime or not. Moreover, it goes only once through the elements from 2 to $ n/2 $, so the growth is said to be linear.\n",

These workshops will present you, in time, little by little, how vital these libraries are. We will actually witness this quite soon enough."
