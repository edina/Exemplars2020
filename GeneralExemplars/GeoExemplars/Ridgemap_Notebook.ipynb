    "# Plotting elevation data using ridge_map\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ridge_map](https://github.com/ColCarroll/ridge_map) is a python library aimed at creating ridge maps of elevaton data which comes from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), high resolution topographic data collected in 2000 and released in 2015. SRTM data are sampled at a resolution of 1 arc-second (about 30 meters) and provided to <code>ridge_map</code> via the python package SRTM.py, which is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook illustrates how to create ridge maps of Great Britain and the Lake District. Great Britain was chosen to show the large scale maps this library can achieve in comparison to others where the data is split into tiles. This usually results in many separate smaller files that need to be pre-processed. Substantially larger polygons can be selected, although SRTM is not available for latitudes outside of the range N 60° - S 60°. The Lake District was chosen so that the image can be reasonably compared to maps plotted using other libraries, which can be viewed in the Exemplars on <code>Rasterio</code> and <code>EarthPy</code>. Of course, you can select a bounding box of your area of interest, for example by obtaining the points of a polygon using [bboxfinder](http://bboxfinder.com/). Once you load in the elevation data from SRTM, you can preprocess it to automatically detect lakes, rivers, and oceans, and scale the elevations. <br>\n",
