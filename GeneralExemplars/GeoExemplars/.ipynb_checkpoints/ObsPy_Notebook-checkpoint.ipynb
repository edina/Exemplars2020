    "# Accessing seismic data using Obspy\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>ObsPy</code> is a Python package aimed at processing seismological data, including parsers for common file formats, clients to access data centers and seismological signal processing routines. The different clients hold station, instrument and event information, as well as waveform data. Station information encompasses an inventory of network metadata (code, description,...), station metadata (code, latitude, longitude, elevation, start- and endtime of recordings,...) and channel metadata (location code, latitude, longitude, elevation, dip, azimuth, instrument response, sample rate,...). Amongst other things, it can be used to plot the location of the stations within a network or to plot the instrument response of a seismograph at a particular station. Event information is stored in a catalogue of seismic events, such as natural or human-induced earthquakes. Its metadata includes the origin (location, depth, time), magnitudes (magnitude types), picks, focal mechanisms. Waveform data is stored in a Stream object containing multiple Trace objects with the actual waveform data as a timeseries and the metadata of the station information (network, station, channel, location, sampling rate,...).\n",

    "The International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks implements a large number of data centres such as USGS, NOA and IRIS. This section lists all the available data centres. In further sections, only USGS and IRIS is used, but the method to access the other data centres is the same so the code could be adapted to fit them. The data centres do not necessarily offer all three types of data (waveform, station and event information), so if you are unsure which provider to use, you can use a routing client instead of explicitly specifying the client.

In this section, the Global Seismograph Network of IRIS/USGS (network code:'IU') is used as it has a large number of station across the world. IU is one of the most commonly used networks, but other local networks might be more suitable for you depending on the kind of data you are interested in.

    "## Plotting waveform data - seismograms\n",
    "As explained above, there are different seismic networks which are available to use and they all have a list of stations within the network. To access the actual waveform data, however, it is not enough to specify the network and the station. You also need to define which channel and location code you are interested in. The channels and location codes for the individual stations within IU can be found [here](http://service.iris.edu/irisws/fedcatalog/1/query?net=IU&format=text&includeoverlaps=true&nodata=404).\n",
    "\n",
    "Channel codes are usually made up of a set of three letters. The first letter refers to the  general sampling rate and the response band of the instrument such as S for short-period instrument. The second letter specifies the type of instrument that is used, such as H for a high-gain seismometer. The third letter indicates the orientation of the sensor measurement and is an axis of a 3D orthogonal coordinate system, such as Z,N,E for Vertical, North-South, East-West. The full list of abbreviations for the channel code can be found [here](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/seed-channel-naming/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The location code is a 2 character code used to uniquely identify different data streams at a single station. These IDs are commonly used to logically separate multiple instruments or sensor sets at a single station.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchy of station data is: network $\\rightarrow$ station $\\rightarrow$ location code and channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section the waveform data from one station located at Bilibino, Russia (BILL) or Cathedral Cave, Missouri, USA (CCM) is extracted at the time of the 26.12.2004 Sumatra earthquake (from the catalogue in the previous section in this Notebook). Data for all three orientations (ZNE) from both short- (S) and long-period (L) high-gain seismometers were retrieved and plotted on a seismogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrivals of different phases (waves originating from the earthquake) to the selected station can be detected from the seismogram if the reader knows the characteristics of the different elastic waves and phases (such as their polarisation). The most straightforward one to identify is the P-wave, as it is the first arrival on the seismogram, often most visible in the vertical component of the seismogram. All you need is to identify the time of the first real motion that is not background static. For BILL, this happens at 01:10:57, indicating that the P-wave took 12min 5sec to reach the station from the earthquake origin. This knowledge is often used to identify the location of the earthquake if data is available from at least 3 stations (in this case, however, we already knew where it happened).\n",

Certain frequency ranges can be filtered out in order to improve the signal to noise ratio. Of course, for the result to be sensible, you need more insight into filtering, but this section shows how the filters can be created in a Notebook. A widget was added where the type of filter and the corresponding frequency range can be selected. The first cell filters the data from the short-period instrument, whereas the second cell filters the long-period seismometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 filtering options:\n",
    "- <code>highpass</code> - filters out frequencies above a certain frequency (given by maximum frequency in widget)\n",
    "- <code>lowpass</code> - filters out frequencies below a certain frequency (given by minimum frequency in widget)\n",
    "- <code>bandpass</code> - filters out frequencies outside of a specified frequency range (given by both minimum and maximum frequency in widget)\n",
    "- <code>bandstop</code> - filters out frequencies within a specified frequency range (given by both minimum and maximum frequency in widget)\n",
    "\n",
    "More information and more advanced examples of filtering can be found [here](https://krischer.github.io/seismo_live_build/html/Signal%20Processing/filter_basics_solution_wrapper.html) and [here](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.signal.filter.html#module-obspy.signal.filter).\n",

    "## Instrument response\n",
    "The instrument response describes how incoming data (in whatever the instrument measures) is transformed into what is finally stored in a file. Different types of seismometers respond differently to waves of a certain frequency. Short-period seismometers are more sensitive to high frequency waves so the amplitude seen on the seismograms will be considerably larger and more pronounced for a high frequency wave (such as P-waves) than for low frequency waves (such as surface waves). Long-period seismometers are pick up low frequency waves (such as surface waves) more than the high frequency waves (such as P-waves). This is all due to the physics of simple harmonic motion and resonance. Therefore, it is often useful to plot the instrument response (amplitude and phase delay) against the frequency spectrum.\n",

    "The sampling rate $Δt$ of the instrument (the Nyquist frequency is $f_N=1/(2Δt)$ ) is shown as the dashed vertical line. The plot does not show frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency (the vertical dashed line) as these frequencies do not exist in the data and thus have no physical meaning.\n",

    "## Phase arrivals and travel time curves\n",
    "After an earthquake occurs, stations around the world pick up the seismic signals after a certain time dely. This delay depends on how far away the the station is located from the earthquake hypocentre (origin within the Earth) and the type of wave (phase) it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of waves: body and surface waves. The most basic body and surface waves are P- and S-waves, and Love and Rayleigh waves respectively. They all have characteristic wave speeds based on the material they are propagating in, however their relative speeds in the same medium stays the same, with P-waves being the fastest, then S-waves followed by Love and finally Rayleigh waves. However, due to internal diffractions, reflections and refractions within the Earth, these aren't the only phases see on the seismogram. There are all kinds of combinations of different wave types such as 'PS' (P-wave that converted into S-wave upon reflection) or reflected phases like 'PPP' (P-wave internally reflected off the surface) or refracted phases such as 'PKIKP' (P-wave refracted through the inner and outer core). This leads to a very complex order of phase arrivals. These can be visualised in travel time curves, where the travel time is plotted against the source-receiver distance using the <code>plot_travel_times()</code> method of the obspy.taup module. The module encompasses several different models of the Earth's structure, so the travel time mastercurve can be plotted for each model. These plots are often used to help determine the location of the earthquake since the travel time differences between phases are unique to the source-receiver distances. It can also explicitly print the travel time for the selected phases originating from a pre-determined source depth and source-receiver distance using <code>get_travel_times()</code>.\n",
