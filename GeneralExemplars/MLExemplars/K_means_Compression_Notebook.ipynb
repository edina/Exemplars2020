    "\n",
    "So the first layer, which deals with red, is a $(M,N)$ array that contains a number for every pixel in the image, to represent the amount of red in that pixel. The value is between 0 and 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all RGB values are 0, the pixel is black. If all RGB values are 255, the pixel is white.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: suppose the $(100,50,1)th$ element of the array contains the value 0. This means that the pixel at row 100 and column 50 has no green at all. "
