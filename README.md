# Exemplars2020

Guides, tutorials and exemplar notebooks for the Noteable service.
This repo is divided into topical exemplars which make use of the Noteable service's feature to manage additional libraries and packages for programming with. The main goal of Noteable as a service is to provide a managed, centralised place available online to run and manage computational notebooks. 
In this repo, you will find Jupyter notebooks focussing on Geospatial analysis, Machine Learning, medical analysis and more. 
Coding activities for students include a set of tutorials and exemplar notebooks for reference, adaptation and use in classroom, in accordance with the Scottish Curriculum for Computing Science at National 3, 4, 5, Higher and Advanced Higher levels.
